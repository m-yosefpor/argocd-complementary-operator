# [ArgoCD](https://argo-cd.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) Complementary Operator

> Manage your ArgoCD users and project with ease and some lables

Add ArgocdUser CRD to be able to create static ArgoCD user for each argocduser.
Also, it creates ArgoCD project based on lables you have on the namespaces.

## Instructions
```
apiVersion: argocd.snappcloud.io/v1alpha1
kind: ArgocdUser
metadata:
  name: {{argocduserName}}
spec:
  admin:
    ciPass: ******
    users:
    - user1
    - user2
  view:
    ciPass: ******
    users:
    - user1
    - user2
```
### Development

* `make generate` update the generated code for that resource type.
* `make manifests` Generating CRD manifests.
* `make test` Run tests.

### Build

Export your image name:

```
export IMG=ghcr.io/your-repo-path/image-name:latest
```

* `make build` builds golang app locally.
* `make docker-build` build docker image locally.
* `make docker-push` push container image to registry.

### Run, Deploy
* `make run` run app locally
* `make deploy` deploy to k8s.

### Clean up

* `make undeploy` delete resouces in k8s.

| controller_runtime_active_workers | Number of currently used workers per controller
| controller_runtime_max_concurrent_reconciles | Maximum number of concurrent reconciles per controller
| controller_runtime_reconcile_errors_total | Total number of reconciliation errors per controller
| controller_runtime_reconcile_time_seconds | Length of time per reconciliation per controller
| controller_runtime_reconcile_total | Total number of reconciliations per controller
| rest_client_request_latency_seconds | Request latency in seconds. Broken down by verb and URL.
| rest_client_requests_total | Number of HTTP requests, partitioned by status code, method, and host.
| workqueue_adds_total | Total number of adds handled by workqueue
| workqueue_depth | Current depth of workqueue
| workqueue_longest_running_processor_seconds | How many seconds has the longest running processor for workqueue been running.
| workqueue_queue_duration_seconds | How long in seconds an item stays in workqueue before being requested
| workqueue_retries_total | Total number of retries handled by workqueue
| workqueue_unfinished_work_seconds | How many seconds of work has been done that is in progress and hasn't been observed by work_duration. Large values indicate stuck threads. One can deduce the number of stuck threads by observing the rate at which this increases.
